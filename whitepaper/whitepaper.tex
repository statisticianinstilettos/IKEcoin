\section{User-Customer Transacton example}
\subsubsection*{Economic Agents}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textit{User}\textbf{---}An individual consumer who has established ownership over their data by claiming their IKEcoin and connecting their social media accounts to their token.
\item \textit{Customer}\textbf{---}A company seeking to obtain access and legal authorization to the User's data.
\end{itemize}

There are several steps in a successful IKEcoin transaction between the User and Customer. Consider this example where Isaac is an avid social media user with a passion for skiing, and he is connecting his data with an e-commerce company specialized in selling ski equipment. The steps in the transaction are;
\begin{enumerate}

\item Isaac sets up his IKEcoin account by claiming his IKEcoin at ikecoin.com. He connects his social media accounts to his IKEcoin auth protocol.

\item The value of his IKEcoin is based on the fair market value for the data, the number of accounts linked, and the size of the data he connected

\item An e-commerce company focused on selling ski equipment has enabled IKEcoin auth at login. They have written a clear terms of service agreement detailing how they will use data obtained through IKEcoin auth. Isaac accepts this agreement and uses his IKEcoin auth to log in to the website

\item The e-commerce site pays Isaac for access to his data  in IKEtokens
    
\item The e-commerce website uses Isaac's social media data to improve their ML algorithm that gives personalized product recommendations 
    
\item Isaac buys the new set of ski boots recommended to him by the ML algorithm    
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection*{Benefit to the User}
\begin{itemize}
